I am a design-focused software engineer. I believe in [craftsmanship](/articles/craftsmanship) - the quality that comes from creating with passion, care and attention to detail.

I am currently **freelancing** - consulting and writing code for tech startups and digital teams in museums.

JavaScript is my favourite programming language and these are my preferred technologies:

- Node
- React
- GraphQL
- Next.js
- 👉[See a complete list](/tech-stack)

Outside work, I'm regularly trying to get better at:

- [Muay Thai](/blog/muay-thai)
- [Interior design and woodworking](/blog/interior-design)
- [Cooking Japanese food](/blog/food)

I live in Sydney with my wife [Michele](http://www.mishwong.com) and our 🐶 [Perry](/blog/perry-the-minifoxie). I love my wife and I love this city. It's got the [best coffees](/blog/australian-coffee) and [delicious food](/blog/australian-food) from all around the world.

We both love the Japanese culture and regularly travel to Japan for food, shopping and to get pumped up by [thoughtful Japanese designs](/blog/thoughtful-japanese-designs).
